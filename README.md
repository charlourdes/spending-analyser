Hello, thank you for considering my application! I have enjoyed doing this task. 

Short overview and requirments achieved: 

I have built a AI Spending analyser. This prototype includes:
1. Synthetic but realistic debit card transaction. 
2. Visualisations that provide further insight into user spending
3. AI summarisation to explain customer spending patterns (often a very numerical subject) into natural language. 



Tech stack:
Python, Streamlit, Plotly, Pandas and OpenAI



Deeper dive into the requirments and what I have delivered:

1. synthetic debit data - creates realistic card transactions including data on merchants, spending catagories, amounts in Â£ and times of purchase.

2. interactive visualisation with Plotly - includes easy table of all transactions in September, spending by catagory and spending over time (the month of september).

3. AI powered summaries uses an OpenAI API - I have included a prompt to ensure summaries are friendly and which highlight spending which users would be interested to know. 
including - Biggest spending catagories, frequent merchants and notable patterns (e.g spending on weekends vs weekdays).


I have built this task with Streamlit to bring a simply web interface and for quick prototyping and deployment.
